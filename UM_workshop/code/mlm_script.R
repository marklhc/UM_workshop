# Install Packages --------------------------------------------------------

# This RStudio Cloud space already included the required packages for you to
# follow this workshop. However, if you're to run the analyses demonstrated in
# this workshop, you need the following packages:

# install.packages(c("lme4", "tidyverse", "psych", "texreg", "gridExtra"))

# For Bayesian analyses, you may also need to install `rstan`, which is a bit
# complicated and you'll need to follow the steps for your OS in
# https://github.com/stan-dev/rstan/wiki/RStan-Getting-Started. You'll then 
# need to install the `brms` package:

# install.packages("brms")
